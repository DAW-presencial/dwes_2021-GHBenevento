I was not able to change my database setup so it's mysql and you will have to run it from localhost, I have uploaded my project to the remote server but it isn't connected to the databse.

I've added an sql script of my database and table incase you want to use it and not have to change the variable names.(/database/database.sql)

In /includes/db.php you can find the DB class and if needed please change the servername, username and/or password variables for it to work for you.
