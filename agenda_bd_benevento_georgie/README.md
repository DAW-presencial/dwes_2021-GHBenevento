I've added an sql script of my database and table incase you want to use it and not have to change the variable names.

In includes/db.php you can find the DB class and if needed please change the servername, username and/or password variables for it to work for you.

To add a contact you add a name and number and press Add contact.

To edit a contact you add a name that already exists and give a new number and press Edit contact.

To delete a contact you just have to enter the name and press Delete contact.
